                <p>
                    In common with most other websites, we use cookies. A cookie is a small piece of text sent from
                    a website and
                    stored in your web browser. The cookie can be retrieved by the website the next time you return
                    to the
                    website, so that the website can, for example, remember your saved preferences. By continuing to
                    use this
                    website you agree to us placing cookies on your computer.
                </p>
                <h1>What are Cookies?</h1>
                <p>
                    Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded to your
                    device when you
                    visit our website. Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages
                    efficiently,
                    remembering your preferences, and generally improving the user experience. They can also help to
                    ensure that
                    adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.
                    Cookies can be "First Party", i.e. set by us, or "Third Party" – set by another company to
                    perform the
                    function, for example, Google Analytics.
                </p>
                <h1>How can I prevent Cookies from being used?</h1>
                <p>
                    When you first visit our website, unless you change your Cookies Settings, we will continue to
                    set all Cookies
                    on your device. You can find out how to do this for your particular browser by clicking "help"
                    on your
                    browser's menu or by visiting http://www.allaboutcookies.org/manage-cookies/index.html.
                    However, please be aware that should you choose to disable cookies it may prevent you from
                    taking full
                    advantage of the website and some of the websites may fail to work.
                    If you do not consent to Advertising cookies, you may be served the same adverts repeatedly and
                    we won’t be
                    able to serve you adverts that are personally relevant to you.
                </p>
                <h1>Use of Cookies by Us</h1>
                <p>
                    When someone visits our website we collect standard internet log information. We do this to find
                    out things
                    such as the number of visitors to the various parts of the website. We collect this information
                    in a way which
                    does not identify anyone.
                    We may also allow cookies to be set by several independent measurement and research companies.
                    These companies
                    read and write their own cookies onto your devices. For example, these cookies are used to track
                    the adverts
                    and keep count of the number of times that each advert is viewed by users. We use this type of
                    information to
                    help improve the services the website provides to you.
                    If we do want to collect personally identifiable information through any of the websites, we
                    will be upfront

                    with it. For further details of our Privacy Policy please click here.
